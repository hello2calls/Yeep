This spa is the place to go if you're looking for a Japanese styles communal bath spa experience. The staff is friendly and efficient which is appreciated as it can get pretty busy there sometimes. Surrounded by good eats and a highly rated movie theatre, this is the spot for when you need that rest and relaxation.",

I told Danielle it was tough to choose between the facial massage, neck therapy and hot stone foot massage since they all sounded so amazing. She ended up doing a little bit of each on me and it was incredible! She really got deep into my muscles and made me so relaxed",

I like this place because of its variety.\n\nIt has its basics but the add ons are what really makes it in my opinion. I love getting my Mac and cheese with breadcrumbs and hot dogs, call me trash all you want but it is really good!!! They offer other toppings too such as vegetables, bacon and more. You basically have unlimited variations.\n\nThe only downside I see is that the toppings add up, and it can get pretty pricey. My friend spent $20 on his dish before. But the counter to that is personally for me, I can't finish one plate by myself so if you aren't someone with the biggest appetite this could be a 2 in 1 meal.\n\nYou should try this place at least once to know the hype!",

This time, I tried out their vegan mac n cheese for the first time, and I did not regret it. The server recommended that I try it with the mexican flavoring since she said that the regular vegan mac n cheese is good but not super flavorful. With the mexican adobo sauce, cilantro, lime, and soyrizo, the vegan mac n cheese ended up being delicious. It didn't taste super \"cheesy\" but it was creamy, spicy, and savory. I'm so glad that their non-dairy option did not dissapoint since it is so hard to find dairy-free mac n cheese anywhere. It was delicious and I may be trying more of their vegan mac n cheeses again soon.\n\nI came here at 2:30 on a Sunday and only had to wait about 10 minutes before getting a table.

The Original Ramen consists of a beef bone broth and came with incredibly tender beef filets, a delicious black truffle oil, bouncy noodles, slices of king oyster mushroom, an onsen egg, and green onions.  The ramen broth was light yet flavorful.  The king oyster mushrooms were very fresh and had a creamy coconut taste to them!  The onsen egg and noodles were cooked perfectly.  The Oxtail beef was also tender and fall off the bone, and it was marinated in a thick tomato stew that is really familiar.",

It's way smaller than the other shops and the line is ridiculously long. After you place your order, there's a ton of people at the other half of the waiting area hanging around for their drinks. If you wait outside, most likely your drink is given to someone else or someone effed up decides to steal it, so no good.\n\nMatcha Latte is easily one of my favorite drinks here. They recommend 75% sweet and I think that's WAYYYYY too sweet. Especially when you order their boba and it comes with a honey-like syrup, it's too much sugar overall. If you get boba, maybe consider 25% sweet. Without boba, 50% should be puuurfect.\n\nAlso delicious: Hong Kong Milk Tea, Strawberry Matcha Latte and their Mango Tea (only available during the summer!)",
